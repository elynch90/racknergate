## üìå PERJURY BY PETITIONER FRANK HACKENBURG
Violation of D.C. Code ¬ß 22‚Äì2402 ‚Äì Knowingly False Sworn Statement in a Court Proceeding

## Summary:
Petitioner Francis ‚ÄúFrank‚Äù Hackenburg knowingly submitted a materially false sworn affidavit to the DC Superior Court in support of an anti-stalking order against whistleblower Elliott M. Lynch. The false statement directly misrepresents the tone, content, and intent of an email sent on March 17, 2025 ‚Äî a communication that is now preserved, timestamped, and publicly disclosed.

## False Claim in the Affidavit:
"Sent an email communication to myself (his former employer) declaring I had a deadline of April 1 to discuss a settlement for perceived wrongs with an ominous threat of what would happen if we didn‚Äôt."

Verifiable Truth (Exhibit Attached: Final Offer ‚Äì St. Patrick‚Äôs Day Resolution Opportunity):
The email in question was a professional, respectful settlement offer, containing no threats, coercion, or hostile language.

The phrase ‚ÄúOtherwise üè¥‚Äù was the only metaphorical signal used, intended as a symbolic closing of opportunity (referencing a pirate flag, commonly understood to signal surrender or finality).

Nowhere does the email include any threats of violence or stalking.

The subject line (‚ÄúFinal Offer ‚Äì St. Patrick‚Äôs Day Resolution Opportunity‚Äù) and tone throughout reflect good faith legal outreach, not criminal intent.

Why This Constitutes Perjury:
Under D.C. Code ¬ß 22‚Äì2402, perjury is committed when a person, ‚Äúin any declaration, verification, certificate, statement, oath, or affidavit required by law, knowingly makes any false material declaration.‚Äù

The affidavit was submitted under penalty of perjury in support of a protective order.

The email is material to the outcome ‚Äî the ASO would not have been granted without it.

The petitioner had access to the original email, meaning the misrepresentation was knowingly false.

Legal Implications:
Frank Hackenburg is now liable for:

Perjury (D.C. Code ¬ß 22‚Äì2402),

Fraud upon the court (Knowingly misleading a judicial officer to obtain a ruling),

Obstruction of justice (Interfering with the lawful exercise of federal rights),

Retaliation against a whistleblower (by weaponizing judicial systems to discredit or silence protected disclosures),

And potentially conspiracy to commit fraud if coordinated with others.

## Conclusion:
If this Anti-Stalking Order was secured through perjury, and the court continues to act upon it despite irrefutable evidence to the contrary, then the court itself becomes complicit in the fraud.

The affidavit must be rescinded immediately, and a full investigation launched into both the false statements made and the institutional failures that allowed them to be accepted without scrutiny.

Whistleblower communications are not threats.
Truth is not harassment.
And justice cannot coexist with lies.

## CONCLUSION
IF THE COURT CLAIMS A RETURN SERVICE HAS THE DATE AS 4/3/25 HOW IS ELLIOTT LYNCH IN POSSESSION OF PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE AND METADATA OF HAVING THE DOCUMENT AS FAR BACK AS MARCH 30TH 2025 AND CLAIMS IT WAS DELIVERED TO HIM AS AN ATTEMPTED WITNESS INTIMIDATION FOR HIS DISCLOSURES AS A FEDERAL WHISTLEBLOWER.

ADDITIONALLY WHY WAS HE ON THE PHONE FOR 12 MINS WITH THE SF FBI TO REPORT THE FORGERY AND WITNESS INTIMIDATION ON 3/31/25 @ 4:17 PM PACIFIC STANDARD TIME BEFORE THE COURT CLAIMS HE WAS EVEN SERVED?

## SUSPECT AT LARGE:
AS NOTED -- ON MARCH 28TH SOMETIME BEWEEN THE HOURS OF 2PM AND 4PM PST I WAS ILLEGALLY SERVED A FRAUDULENT COURT SUMMONS AT MY RESIDENCE IN FAIRFIELD CALIFORNIA.

THE ITEM ARRIVED AND WAS NOT IN AN ENEVELOPE OR MARKED BUT PRESENTED IN A PLASTIC FILM SIMILAR TO A COMIC BOOK SLEEVE.

AS SUCH IT WAS WEAPONIZED AS MY NEIGHBORS CHILDREN WERE ALIGNED IN MY DRIVEWAY ON THEIR BICYLES WATCHING/SERVING AS AN AUDIENCE.

I BELIEVE THE SUSPECT INTERACTED WITH THEM AND POSSIBLY SLANDERED ME IN ORDER TO CREATE FEAR AND A SENSE OF DANGER REGARDING ME AS A NEIGHBOR.

## DESCRIPTION
* WHITE MALE (PRODOMINENT 'ARYAN' FEATURES IN MY PERSONAL OPINION) APPROXIMATELY 28-34 6' 180-190LB.
* GIVEN HIS DESCRIPTION AND FRANK'S GERMAN HERITAGE IT COULD BE POSSIBLE HE IS LINKED TO NEONAZISM OR WHITE NATIONAL AFFILAITION
* I SUSPECT HE WAS AN AGENT FROM THE DARK WEB

## POTENTIALLY CORRELATED FAILED ROBBERY (PERCEIVED)
FURTHERMORE -- ON 11/3/23 AT APROXIMATELY 1:43AM I WAS AT THE ARCO GAS STATION AFTER PICKING UP MY CAR -- IN THE PROCESS OF MOVING HOUSES AND RETURNING A UHAUL. AFTER FILLING UP, I WENT TO PUT AIR IN MY TIRES AT THE SERVICE AREA AND WAS BLOCKED IN PERPENDICULARLY BY A RED DODGE RAM 1500 OR SIMILAR RAM. I IMMEDIATLY WENT INTO EVASIVE MANUEVERS AND STARTED THE VEHICLE -- CRACKED THE WINDOW AND COMMANDED I WOULD PROCEED TO RAM THEM IF THEY DIDN'T MOVE. FORTUNATELY HE PANICKED AND REVERSED AND I WAS ABLE TO GET AWAY AFTER CALLING OUT 'PSYCHO' AS I LEFT THE GAS STATION.
I DID NOT REPORT THIS INCIDENT AS NOTHING MATERIAL TRANSPIRED HOWEVER WHILE I YELLED OUT I GOT A GLIMPSE OF THE MANS FACE AND COULD SEE HE WAS WHITE.
IT IS MY PERSONAL OPINION THAT THIS WAS THE SAME MAN THAT DELIVERED THE FORGED COURT ORDER AS WHEN I INSPECTED HIS FACE I HAD THE UNCANNY SENSE THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME I HAD SEEN HIM.

WHILE THIS MIGHT BE PURELY ANNECDOTAL IT IS WORTH CONSIDERING AS THIS ONLY OCCURED 2 MONTHS BEFORE MY WORKPLACE HARASSMENT BEGAN (1/24).
