ADDITIONALLY WHY WAS HE ON THE PHONE FOR 12 MINS WITH THE SF FBI TO REPORT THE FORGERY AND WITNESS INTIMIDATION ON 3/31/25 @ 4:17 PM PACIFIC STANDARD TIME BEFORE THE COURT CLAIMS HE WAS EVEN SERVED?

### ðŸ“Ž NOTE TO THE FBI
If you have, in fact, been investigating this matter all along â€” I am willing and prepared to issue a public retraction of the prior statements made by raster.ai condemning your inaction.

I acknowledge that I do not know the full scope of your agencyâ€™s operations, and itâ€™s becoming clear that this situation may be far larger and more complex than I initially understood.

#### Let it be known:
<i>I am not here to dictate your actions â€” I am simply a dedicated patriot, committed to the ideals laid down by the founding fathers of this country. And I will continue to fight to defend them, as this evidence packet â€” Racknergate â€” clearly demonstrates.</i>
